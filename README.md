# Zonda
Project Zonda is a week-end/side project to develop a rust based Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software using an immersed boundary methods and a cartesian
grid [with automatic mesh refinement]. A specificity of the project is to
be able to deliver the CFD solver via a web interface - and targeting being
able to run the CFD analysis within the web-browser as an option, using the 
CFD solver compiled to WebAssembly.
